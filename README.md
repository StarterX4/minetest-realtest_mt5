The RealTest Game
=================

RealTest is an open-ended sandbox building game with a focus on realism, especially with ores. There are many different ores, and getting new tools is generally much more complex than in similar games. Eventually, you will be able to build a nice little home. There are no monsters.

Read the "Getting started" section if you are new, most game mechanics are not obvious to figure out on your own.

For Minetest 5.0.0 or later.

This game was originally released by sda97 in 2012 (originally for Minetest 0.4.5). In 2020, Wuzzy has picked up this game to make it compatible with Minetest 5.1.1 (or later), fixing many bugs. Apart from that, absolutely no gameplay changes have been made. This game release has been done to basically preserve a part of Minetest history.

## Getting started
### Crafting guide
This game does not have a crafting guide (yet), it's strongly recommended you first install a crafting guide mod. For this game, `craftguide` by kilbith is recommended, with Progressive Mode turned on (otherwise you will be quite overwhelmed by the huge number of recipes at the start).

### First wood
All you have are hands that are good for light cases.
The first thing to do is to find trees. But you can't break a tree with hands. No problem: you can dig dirt under a tree. After that, the tree collapses and you get logs, sticks and saplings.

### First tools
First you need to find a few stones. They lie around, loose on the ground.

Now add up the stones in the crafting for getting a tool head.

Now you should join tool head with stick (they have to stay you from cutting the tree, or just a broken leaves) and take the stone tool. This tool is slow, but it can help.

### First home
The first house is the best hollow in the rock or constructed of planks. To break into the rock, use the pick that you previously obtained.

To obtain planks, place a log on the ground and cut it with an ax. You will get 4 boards, from which you can craft wooden objects.

If you hollow out a house in the ore you'll see two problems: the housing problem and the problem with the ore.

Also, you can just climb up the tree and leave the thing in the chest.

### Bonfire

To start a bonfire, you need something to ignite it. Connect two sticks in the crafting grid. You will get the "Sticks", a tool that can make a bonfire or furnace.

Now throw five sticks on the ground and use them two sticks.

A fire might not work the first time. You might need to spend a few lighters, to do this.

Now you use the right mouse button to see the fire and its interface.

Left are slots: Lower fuel and top for what you need to cook. On the right are slots for the result.

Bonfire will not disappear if you do not put the fuel, but goes out. Later it will be easy to rekindle: Put in the the fuel and use the sticks.

Now let's make a couple of torches. Put a stick in the source slot and the result will be two torches on each stick.

### Metal time!

You probably are already tired of stone tools, so let's get some metals. In the game there are a lot. In addition, they have a different strength. For example, cast iron solid copper, steel durable cast iron. The strongest is black steel. That is why the work metals can only be strong enough anvils.

To start, you need light metals: Bismuth, zinc and tin. They are obtained from the smelting of bismuthinite, cassiterite and sphalerite.

Look for ore deposits. Now finding deposits is much more complicated, but they are also very large (up to 850 pieces). We don't need so much for now. But the ore is not so easy to smelt, it will be spread. Therefore, we need molds. They can sculpt in clay and burn at the stake. Clay is not a scarce resource, because it is found inside sand in the sea or at beaches and/or in the ground, but only next to water bodies. You'll need it very much.

Then put in the form of ore and smelt it in the bonfire.

You now have a metal, but how to get it out of shape? This requires an anvil. You can make one out of solid rock. To get it, you need a block of stone from all sides. Stone can be folded stone anvil.

Now you need a hammer. How to do it has been described in the section of stone tools.

Now open the anvil, put a metal hammer in the correct slot and break the form.
You got bullion, but what to do with it? Sure to strike! But forging need to know what to strike.

### Futher playing
There are many ores to find and many things to craft. From now on, you should be able to proceed on your own. Have fun!
